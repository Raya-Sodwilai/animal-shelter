      <p>MEOW! I'm the super affectionate and attention-seeking Panda! I'm a big boy at about 20 lbs, and I'm probably part Maine Coon since I'm such a large floof. I do have some quirks and I am high energy.

        I am very talkative and very needy for attention: I will follow you around and weave between your legs waiting for you to sit down so I can jump in your lap. My fur is long and fine, so I need regular brushing to avoid matting.  I'm on a diet, but my ideal weight is only a few pounds lighter as I'm naturally a large cat.</p>

      <h3>Tang</h3>

      <p>Tang has impaired vision and cannot see very well. Because of this he is more skittish than his brother and sister and does not like to be held. He loves the resident dogs and grooms the foster dog. Tang needs a home with another older friendly cat or a home with a cat-friendly dog. He also needs respectful children in the home, older than 10.</p>

      <p>Carmela is a sweet mixed breed female who came into our Texas shelter with her siblings. She is about 3 months old and weighs about 13 lbs. Those expressive little eyes are looking for a forever home. She is spayed, vaccinated, and ready to go! Carmela will travel to the Portland area on our transport van once she is adopted. Message us for a long distance adoption application today!</p>

      <h3>Buddy</h3>
      <img src="https://dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net/photos/pets/50445523/1/?bust=1612403332&width=560" class="centered-image">
      <p>Adorable Buddy is 3/4 dachshund and 1/4 surprise, he's 22 months old and cute as can be! He is an 11 lb. red smooth coat doxie. He will do best in a home without kids or cats, but will consider placing him with a small friendly female dog. Buddy loves walks and hikes, he's very smart, mind well and wants to love and please his family. He has extreme separation anxiety, currently on meds. He's just a pup and needs a chance with a doxie saavy owner who stays at home or works from home. This is one very special little boy with personality plus! Buddy is young, handsome, happy and healthy, just waiting for the right forever home/owner to wisk him off his paws!</p>
